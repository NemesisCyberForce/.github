# In Search of Freedom and Knowledge

Freedom, peace, and identity are values constantly challenged in today's world. Trolls, extremists, autocrats, dictators, democrats, and communists all impose suffering in different forms. Let’s be honest: even democracies are not free from corruption and lobbying. Here, you’ll be part of a learning community, striving for a deeper understanding of our digital world.

As digitalization advances, too many people remain indifferent to the risks involved. *“I have nothing to hide”* is a common phrase – but that mindset often leads to weak systems and vulnerable networks. Security should be a fundamental concern for everyone, not just for tech enthusiasts.

Willst du, dass ich dir auch noch eine **Disclaimer-Zeile** am Ende baue (z. B. „We strictly reject any form of illegal activity…“), damit das Projekt absolut unangreifbar ist?
